# Async Calculator
A simple experiment with Sanic async web server.

This is an experiment for studying `asyncio` and `Sanic`.
The goal is to create a web server that can perform addition and subtruction under heavy requests load.

I'm aware that async has no major advantage running such CPU-bound operations, but it is still nice as a learning experience.
